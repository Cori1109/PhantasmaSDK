# PhantasmaSDK

## Javascript Sample app instructions

This is a simple wallet sample that needs to be connected to a RPC node. By default it uses the localhost:7077/rpc endpoint, but you can switch to your own URL.

To run the sample app, follow these steps:

1. Overwrite the existing PhantasmaAPI.java on the sample project with the latest one from Output/temp/Java/Libs

2. Open the index.html with your browser of choice and go into the developer console to see the outputs!
