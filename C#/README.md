## C# Wallet Sample
This is a simple wallet sample that needs to be connected to a RPC node. By default it uses the localhost:7077/rpc endpoint, but you can switch to your own URL.
  
If there are problems with missing project references, be sure to clone [PhantasmaChain](https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaChain) and the [RPC Client](https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaRpcClient) and point them to the solution.
