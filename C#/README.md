# PhantasmaSDK

## Wallet Sample
  This is a simple wallet sample that needs to be connected to a RPC node. By default it uses the localhost:7077/rpc endpoint, but you can switch to your own URL [here](https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaSDK/blob/master/C%23/WalletSample/WalletSample/Program.cs#L37).
  
  If there are problems with missing project references, be sure to clone [PhantasmaChain](https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaChain) and the [RPC Client](https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaRpcClient) and point them to the solution.
