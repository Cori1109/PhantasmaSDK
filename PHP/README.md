## PHP Sample app instructions

This is a simple wallet sample that needs to be connected to a RPC node. By default it uses the localhost:7077/rpc endpoint, but you can switch to your own URL.

Before you run the sample app, simply change the phantasma.php include location on the index.php file to reflect its location on your pc. Make sure to include the one on the Output/temp/PHP/libs!
